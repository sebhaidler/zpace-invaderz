# Zpace Invaderz (Space Invaders Inspired Game)

Built in Jan. 2025 after about a month of C++ study.

## Context
Learning project to understand low-level game development and C++ fundamentals.
Used ECS library https://github.com/raphaelmayer/easys, shoutout to github.com/raphaelmayer for mentorship!

## What I Implemented
- All game systems (movement, shooting, collision, animation)
- SDL2 integration (rendering, input, audio)
- Game loop timing and state management
- Collision detection algorithms
- Audio system with SDL_mixer --> audio assets removed before publishing repo for licensing reasons.
